Sound Demo

This example application demonstrates the use of the EVALBOT audio system
by cycling through a set of audio clips and playing them using the buttons
and bump sensors.

When the application starts, a message displays for several seconds.  Once
the message is finished, the display shows the name of the first audio
clip.  You can cycle through the available audio clips by pressing the left
and right bump sensors.  The name of each clip selected is shown on the
display.

A clip can be played by pressing the front-most, right user button.  While
the clip is playing, it can be stopped by pressing the rear-most, right
user button.
