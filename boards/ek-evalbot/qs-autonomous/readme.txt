EVALBOT Autonomous Operation

This application controls the EVALBOT, allowing it to operate
autonomously.  When first turned on, the EVALBOT shows messages on the
display and toggles the two LEDs.  Upon pressing button 1, the robot drives
in a straight line.  If one of the bumper sensors is activated, EVALBOT
stops immediately, rotates a random angle, and then resumes driving
forward.  While driving forward, the EVALBOT also makes turns after a
random duration of time.  Pressing button 2 stops the motion.
